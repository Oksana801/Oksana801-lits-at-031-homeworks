Creating the BufferedReader is a two step process. First, we create a FileReader object,1
passing to its constructor the name of the file we want to open in the file system. Given a2
simple filename to read such as "file.txt", Java by default looks for a file with that name
in the program's directory alongside the .java files.4
The FileReader object knows how to read text files, but it does not have all the features
we need. Therefore, we create a BufferedReader built on the FileReader, as shown below.
The BufferedReader supports the readLine() method we want to use, and it does
"buffering" which is a technique that uses a scratch area of memory to speed up the file8
reading process
// The above can be written all on one line like this...
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
FileReader and BufferedReader work with files made of plain text. For non-text files
(.jpeg, .mp3, ...) use FileInputStream instead. For 106A, we will only directly read text
files. Also, there are ways that Java code can specify files in a directory other than the
program directory, however we will not do that in CS106A. For simplicity, we will
always position our data files in the program directory and rely on the simple default16
behavior.
